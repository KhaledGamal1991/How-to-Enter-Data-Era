Installation
XGBoost library should be installed which can be done by running "pip install xgboost" command on terminal. Other than this there should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

Project Motivation
In this project, I shall answer the following business questions using Kaggle Survey 2020:

1.	Introduction 
2.	What's the Best Tools and Knowledge to enter the Field?
3.	Let's predict the Best Job title based on your Skills.
4.	What Affect the Salary?
5.	Conclusion.

File Descriptions
I have added 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. it should be easy to navigate through the notebook from loading the dataset till answering the above questions one by one. I have also added comments and markdown cells to make it easier to navigate and understand the file.

Results
The main findings of the code can be found in the "https://github.com/KhaledGamal1991/How-to-Enter-Data-Era/commit/ed51b71c55340e3edf723b9ed824805f7f914aa3".
